1. Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease among elderly patients, and in the United States is usually secondary to calcific aortic disease. Bicuspid valves represent a large fraction of calcific aortic disease.
2. Patients may be asymptomatic for years, usually until AS is severe. Asymptomatic AS is associated with low mortality, whereas symptomatic AS carries a poor prognosis without intervention.
3. The physical finding of a characteristic AS murmur should prompt transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for initial evaluation.
4. Patients with AS should be followed clinically for the development of symptoms at least yearly and should have serial TTEs at intervals determined by the severity of their AS (table 1).
5. There are no medications that slow the progression of AS. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are managed according to routine guidelines.
6. [Aortic valve replacement](https://oi.mgh.harvard.edu/pcoi/primary_care_guidelines/AorticStenosis.asp#replace) in appropriate patients offers symptom relief, improved exercise capacity, and mortality benefit. [Cardiology referral](https://oi.mgh.harvard.edu/pcoi/primary_care_guidelines/AorticStenosis.asp#ind) for monitoring and/or intervention is appropriate for patients with moderate or severe AS regardless of symptoms, patients with symptoms thought secondary to AS, and patients with congenital AS regardless of severity.
