### Key Clinical Points

1. Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease among elderly patients, and in the United States is usually secondary to calcific aortic disease. Bicuspid valves represent a large fraction of calcific aortic disease.
2. Patients may be asymptomatic for years, usually until AS is severe. Asymptomatic AS is associated with low mortality, whereas symptomatic AS carries a poor prognosis without intervention.
3. The physical finding of a characteristic AS murmur should prompt transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for initial evaluation.
4. Patients with AS should be followed clinically for the development of symptoms at least yearly and should have serial TTEs at intervals determined by the severity of their AS (table 1).
5. There are no medications that slow the progression of AS. Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are managed according to routine guidelines.
6. [Aortic valve replacement](https://oi.mgh.harvard.edu/pcoi/primary_care_guidelines/AorticStenosis.asp#replace) in appropriate patients offers symptom relief, improved exercise capacity, and mortality benefit. [Cardiology referral](https://oi.mgh.harvard.edu/pcoi/primary_care_guidelines/AorticStenosis.asp#ind) for monitoring and/or intervention is appropriate for patients with moderate or severe AS regardless of symptoms, patients with symptoms thought secondary to AS, and patients with congenital AS regardless of severity.

### Background

Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular disease among elderly patients. It is primarily caused by calcific degeneration, congenital abnormalities (typically bicuspid valves, rarely unicuspid valves), and rheumatic heart disease. Other rare etiologies of AS include connective tissue disorders, rheumatologic diseases, radiation, and metabolic disorders. In the United States, calcific degeneration is the predominant cause of AS, whereas in underdeveloped nations, rheumatic fever is the leading cause. Rheumatic disease typically affects the mitral valve; the aortic valve is also affected in about a third of these patients.

The prevalence of AS increases with age. In a study of 3273 subjects in Norway, the prevalence of AS was 0.2% in 50-59 year-olds, 1.3% in 60-69 year-olds, 3.9% in 70-79 year-olds, and 9.8% in 80-89 year-olds. Additional risk factors for AS include male gender, current cigarette smoking, history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Aortic sclerosis, or thickening and focal calcification of the aortic valve, may progress to aortic stenosis. In the Cardiovascular Health Study, about 9% of patients with aortic sclerosis progressed to aortic stenosis over 5 years.

#### Natural History

In patients with AS who are asymptomatic, mortality is low. Symptoms, more than valve area or transaortic pressure gradient, predict poor outcomes, and valve replacement is typically driven by the presence of symptoms. Patients with asymptomatic severe AS typically progress to have symptoms within a few years.

### Evaluation

A pulsus parvus et tardus, or delayed carotid upstroke, may be present in severe AS. A fourth heart sound (S4) can be heard when there is diastolic dysfunction, and a third heart sound (S3) can be heard in severe AS. AS can lead to diastolic dysfunction and signs of heart failure may be seen on exam, including elevated jugular venous pressure, peripheral edema, and crackles on pulmonary examination. In studies correlating physical exam findings with cardiac catheterization and echocardiogram, the findings with the highest positive predictive value with severe AS were:

* Slow rate of increase of carotid pulse (pulsus parvus et tardus)
	* Note that the carotid upstroke may be more normal in elderly patients due to effects of aging on the vasculature.
* Late-peaking murmur
* Decreased intensity/absence of aortic component of the second heart sound, or paradoxical splitting second heart sound
* Apical-carotid delay
	* Apical and right carotid pulses are measured simultaneously; delay is abnormal.
* Brachioradial delay
	* Brachial and radial pulses are measured simultaneously; delay is abnormal.

	#### Further Testing

Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the initial diagnostic test of choice for patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of AS. The severity of AS is classified by the aortic jet velocity, mean gradient across the aortic valve, and aortic valve area, as summarized in Table 1.

The frequency of routine surveillance echocardiography is determined by the severity of AS. In addition, repeat TTE is indicated when symptoms develop or if there is a change in murmur concerning for progression of AS. It may also be appropriate when it is important to better understand patient hemodynamics prior to elective surgery, before or during pregnancy, or in acute situations such as gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, or infection.
