#### Further Testing

Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the initial diagnostic test of choice for patients with signs or symptoms suggestive of AS. The severity of AS is classified by the aortic jet velocity, mean gradient across the aortic valve, and aortic valve area, as summarized in Table 1.

The frequency of routine surveillance echocardiography is determined by the severity of AS. In addition, repeat TTE is indicated when symptoms develop or if there is a change in murmur concerning for progression of AS. It may also be appropriate when it is important to better understand patient hemodynamics prior to elective surgery, before or during pregnancy, or in acute situations such as gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, or infection.
